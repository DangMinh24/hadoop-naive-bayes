Naive Bayes on Hadoop
=====================

This project use the dataset "Cencus Income" from the UCI repository, containing data about the prediction of income of some people.

The dataset can downloaded from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) (specifically, the file adult.data).

# Project Description
For this project we implement a Naive Bayes classifier on Hadoop and test it on “Cencus Income” dataset.

## Preprocess
For the numerical attributes we implemented a discretization with MapReduce on Hadoop.
